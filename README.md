# augere_js - A Lightweight React-like Library

augere_js is a lightweight, from-scratch implementation of a React-like library. It provides a virtual DOM abstraction, a reconciliation algorithm, a component-based architecture, an SPA router, slots for rendering content, and support for server-side rendering.

## Features

1. **Virtual DOM Abstraction**: MyReact maintains a lightweight in-memory representation of the DOM, which allows for efficient updates and re-renders.

2. **Reconciliation Algorithm**: When the state of a component changes, MyReact's reconciliation algorithm determines the minimal set of DOM operations required to update the browser's DOM, ensuring efficient updates.

3. **Component-based Architecture**: Each component in MyReact holds its own state, manages its own lifecycle, and re-renders itself and its children when the state changes.

4. **SPA Router**: augere_js built-in SPA (Single Page Application) router updates the URL in the browser's address bar without reloading the entire page.

5. **Slots**: augere_js allows you to define slots within a component, enabling you to render content inside the component.

6. **HTML Templates**: augere_js compiles HTML templates into JavaScript render functions, providing a familiar and easy-to-use syntax for defining component structure.

7. **Server-side Rendering**: augere_js supports server-side rendering, allowing you to pre-render your application on the server and send the initial HTML to the client, improving initial load times and SEO.
